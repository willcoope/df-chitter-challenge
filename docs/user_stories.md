- As a user, I want to be able to log in with my email and password or username and password, so that I can access my account and post my own peeps.

- As a user, I want to be able to log out of Chitter, so that I can make sure no one will have access to my account.

- As a user, I want the UI to be responsive across all devices, so that I can use the application no matter where I am.
