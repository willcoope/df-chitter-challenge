# Setting Up

- Create a mongoDB database called chitter and two collections, one called users and one called chits for the project.

- Call npm start from the backend folder in a separate terminal (you may need to change the start script in the package.json file as it is set up to run on a windows machine).

- Run the two requests in the signupRequests file and the two requests in the chitRequests file to populate the database with some data.

- Call npm run dev from the frontend folder in a terminal and follow the link to the webpage.

- The webpage should now be running and you will be able to view the posted chits. You can use the login details from the signupRequests file to login and create chits from one of the accounts.

- You will also be able to create a new account, login with these details and post own chits.
