```

## Introduction

DFCorp have decided to branch out and launch their own social media platform called Chitter. They have hired you to build the full stack of the application. The application should be a platform for registered users to post messages to a public stream.  The application will have a front end and a back end. The front end will be a single page application (SPA) and the back end will be a RESTful API, supported by a MongoDB database.

DFCorp hope that this new venture will cement their place as one of the world's leading tech companies and will help them to bring the users of their other applications together in a different way, as well as attracting new users.  They are looking for a modern, responsive, scalable and user-friendly application that will be easy to use and will be able to handle a large number of users.

## Core Features

One again, the Business Analysts have been hard at work and have come up with the following core features for the application:

- Site visitors should be able to see the latest 'Peeps' (posts to Chitter) from all users when they go to the site's homepage without having to create an account or log in
  - These should be displayed in reverse chronological order
- Users should be able to sign up to the application with their email, password, name and a username
  - The username and email should be unique
- Users should be able to log in to the application
  - This should be done using their email or username and password
  - Logged in users should be able to create and post a new 'Peep'
- 'Peeps' should have the name of the user and their user handle
- Users should be able to log out of the application
- The UI should be responsive and work well on different sized devices

> **Note:** The use of a generative AI tool to complete tasks relating to the specific requirements above is NOT allowed.  All work here should be your own.

## Additional Features

The Business Analysts have also come up with some additional features that they would like to see in the application, should time allow for you to do this:

- Logged in users should be able to reply to a 'Peep' from another user
- If a user is tagged in a 'Peep' (i.e. their username is used in the body of a 'Peep' proceeded by an `@` symbol), they should receive an email notification with a copy of the 'Peep' that they were tagged in
- User authentication should be done using JWT technology for added security
- The application should be deployed to a cloud platforms such as Netlify and Render and use a cloud database (e.g. MongoDB Atlas)

> **Note:** The use of a generative AI tool to help complete tasks relating to these further requirements is allowed but should be clearly documented.

## Tasks

1. Write an explanation of why DFCorp should use a single page application (SPA) for the front end of the application
   - Include a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of using a SPA over a traditional multi-page application
   - Include a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of using a SPA over a server-side rendered application
2. Generate user stories for the functionality in the application - these may be at an EPIC level in the first instance
   - Break down the EPIC user stories into smaller, more manageable tasks that focus on the front and back end functionality for *slices* of the application
3. For any front end user stories, create wireframes and/or mockups for the application along with the component hierarchy (you can use Miro for both of these tasks using plugins)
   - ***Note:*** For this application, DFCorp have granted you FULL creative control over the design of the application including layouts and colour schemes but they do urge you to remain focussed on the user experience and to ensure that the application is responsive and accessible
4. For any back end user stories, create a routing diagram and define any *Models* you think are necessary for the application to function
5. As much as possible, use TDD to drive the development of the application - work in slices of the application and write tests for the functionality you are working on
   - Remember to use the "Thinking in React" methodology to help you break down the development of the user interface
   - Remember to use the route-controller-service pattern to help you break down the development of the back end and to write some integration tests
6. Ensure that the application repository can clone and run locally - include a Markdown file with instructions on how to do this and with any initial usernames and passwords that can be used to log in to the application

### BONUS TASK

Deploy your front and back end applications using an online service such as Netlify and Render and use a cloud database such as MongoDB Atlas.  Include a Markdown file with instructions on how to access the deployed application.

---

## Tips

- Commit regularly to GitHub with clear commit messages - write a failing test, pass the test, commit, etc
- You should put your component hierarchies, state identification notation and test plans in the markdown file in the `docs` folder, if you decide to use some form of Scrum board to track your progress, you should include a screenshot of this in the markdown file
- Keep your frontend and backend code in the same repository, using the folders that are provided in the template and structure the folders within these in a suitable manner

> There are a large number of examples of Twitter clones on the internet.  Do not be tempted to simply follow one of these and submit that - these examples are unlikely to meet the requirements of the challenge fully and likely to introduce functionality that has not been asked for!  Often, they do not provide the documentation that you need for submission either and use different technologies to those that have been covered in the Academy.

## Submission

Your Challenge attempt should be submitted via commits to the forked project from GitHub Classroom.  Your trainer will have supplied you with the appropriate link to do access this, you need to take no further action on this platform.  To indicate that you have completed the Challenge, you should you the Assignment Submission link in the Challenge course for your Cohort on Noodle.  The Progression Management Frameworks will be assessed via a marking rubric in Noodle and you will be able to see how you performed in each competency.  Upload any ***`.env`*** files that are not included in your repository to Noodle with your submission.

You are not permitted to collaborate with anyone to complete this challenge.  You should complete the *Core Functionality* using traditional skills, knowledge and understanding of software engineering and all code submitted for this should be your own.  You may use a *Generative AI tool* to help you complete the *Additional Functionality* but this should be clearly documented.

---

## Feedback

After submission of your challenge attempt, your trainer will record and submit feedback in Noodle and/or via GitHub for comments in your code .  You will then be able to view this feedback via Noodle and your GitHub account.

Your trainer will also provide general feedback to the cohort via the Discord channel.
